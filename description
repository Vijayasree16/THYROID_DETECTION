Thyroid detection using machine learning (ML) involves building models to predict thyroid conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism based on patient data.
By analyzing features like hormone levels (TSH, T3, T4), age, and symptoms, ML algorithms can classify thyroid function. 
The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy and assist in early detection, enabling timely medical intervention.
